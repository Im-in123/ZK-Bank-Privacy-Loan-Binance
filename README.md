# ZK-Bank Privacy Loan (Binance)

## Description
**ZK-Bank Privacy Loan (Binance)** is a decentralized application designed to enable privacy-preserving credit verification and loan applications using **zkPass**. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, users can prove their creditworthiness without revealing sensitive financial details. 

The app integrates with the **Binance predefined schemas**, specifically the **Earn Balance** and **Balance in the Last 24 Hours**, to verify users' financial standing. These schemas are combined to generate a composite creditworthiness score, which is then used to approve or reject loan applications.

With **zkPass** and these **Binance schemas**, users can maintain their financial privacy while accessing decentralized loan services.

## 1. Creating a Custom Schema on zkPass

### Steps to Create a Custom Schema:

1. **Visit zkPass Developer Portal:**
   - Go to the [zkPass Developer Portal](https://dev.zkpass.org/).
   - Sign up or log in if you havenâ€™t already.

2. **Create a New App:**
   - Click on **Create New App** and make sure to copy the **appId**, as you will need it for the frontend integration.

3. **Add a Custom Schema:**
   - After creating the app, click on **Add Schema** and select **Custom Schema**.

4. **Set the Schema Details:**
   - Set the schema's **name** to `Binance Financial Data`.
   - Set the **category** to `Finance`.

5. **Define the Schema JSON:**
   - Use the following JSON for the schema definition:
   
   ```json
   {
